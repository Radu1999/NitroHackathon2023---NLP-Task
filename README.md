ML NLP Hackathon solution

Given an imbalanced dataset the task was to identify sexism.

The participants were challenged to develop a pipeline for multi-class text classification in the Romanian language. Specifically, the task was to classify each text into one of five possible categories: (0) Sexist Direct, (1) Sexist Descriptive, (2) Sexist Reporting, (3) Non-sexist Offensive, (4) Non-sexist Non-offensive. The data for this competition has been collected from a variety of sources, including social media networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit, web articles, and books.
